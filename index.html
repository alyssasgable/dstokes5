aboutDescription: Hey! My name is Dylan Stokes. I’m 14 and I live in Montgomery, Alabama. I attend Saint James School and I am currently in 9th grade. Also, I play club soccer for the Capital City Streaks based out of Montgomery. Before playing for the Streaks, I played for FC Torjager and FC Montgomery.
goals: My goals for soccer are to play at the collegiate level and develop further as a player.
purpose: The purpose of this site is to give viewers a quick look at who I am as a person and as a soccer player.
         I think it’s a very unique way to inform viewers rather than me just type it in a email.
         All in all, this site is a useful tool for coaches, family, and myself.
