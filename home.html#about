About Me:
  description: |-
    Hey! My name is Dylan Stokes. I’m 14 and I live in Montgomery, Alabama. I attend Saint James School and I am currently in 9th grade. Also, I play club soccer for the **Capital City Streaks** based out of Montgomery. Before playing for the Streaks, I played for FC Torjager and FC Montgomery.

    My goals for soccer are to play at the collegiate level and develop as a player.
  purpose: The purpose of this site is to give viewers a quick look at who I am as
    a person and as a soccer player. I think it’s a very unique way to inform viewers
    rather than me just type it in a email. All in all, this site is a useful tool
    for coaches, family, and myself.
